                    <h4>THE RULES</h4>
                    <p>Stones are captured when they are surrounded by stones belonging to any combination of opponents. Points are lost for each captured stone.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the game, you gain points based on the size of the on territory surrounded only by your team and/or the board boundaries.</p>
                    <p>A suicide move is illegal unless the move results in the removal of at least one enemy stone.</p>
                    <p>It is illegal to play a move that reverts the board back to the previous state.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide">
                    <h4>- 2 -</h4>
                    <h4>3+ PLAYER GAMES</h4>
                    <p>When three or more players are in the game, the game dynamic becomes slightly more complicated.</p>
                    <p>When an attacking move completely surrounds stones belonging to more than one opponent, the opponent whose turn is coming up sooner is the first to be attacked. If capturing the stones belonging to the first opponent breaks the chain that would have captured the second opponent stones, the second opponent is spared from the attack.</p>
                    <p>While the possibilty of a cooperative attack generally makes survival more challenging, sometimes territory with only one "eye" can survive when all opponents judge that the cost of attacking outweighs the benefit.</p>

                    <h4>THE FREESTYLE MODE</h4>
                    <p>The Freestyle Mode gives players more freedom to explore how the game works. Freestyle Mode allows the player to do the following: </p>
                    <p class='left'>1) The first player may place stones on the board before the second player has entered the game.</p>
                    <p class='left'>2) Players may play out-of-turn. </p>
                    <p class='left'>3) Players may remove stones belonging to the player.</p>
                    <p>While Freestyle Mode allows players to play out of turn, players must still PASS sequentially in order for the game to proceed to the next stage.</p>

                    <h4>- 4 -</h4>
                    <h4>THE CLEAN UP STAGE</h4>
                    <p>A player may choose to skip a turn by clicking <b>PASS</b>. When all players PASS in order, this stage ends and the Clean Up stage begins.</p>
                    <p>During the Clean Up stage, players are encouraged to remove stones belonging to them if they concede that these stones have no hope of survival. When all players have clicked on <b>PASS</b> in order, the score becomes final and the game ends.</p>
