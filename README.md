# Imitation GO

Try [Imitation Go](https://imitation-go.onrender.com/)

This is an experimental version of Go that allows more than two players to play. It was made with node.js and socket.io. It is currently hosted on Render. Load the page on two or more separate browser windows to try out the multiplayer game.

To play the game, after you enter your name and read the instructions, either add a new room or join an existing room. If the free style mode is not chosen, the game will not allow you to play out of turn. The game ends when all players sequentially PASS. The algorithm for calculating the winner is not perfect, so try to clean up the board before ending the game.

If you are new to the game of Go, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRBjN8empIs) for an explanation of how to play the game.
